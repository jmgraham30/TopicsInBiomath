In order to fulfill the learning objectives for EPW Level II students will be asked to complete two writing intensive assignments. These are\na model report assignment,\nand a final project.\nDetails for these assignments are described below and additional guidelines are posted on thee course learning management system.\nCourse Policies and Procedures:\nCoronavirus Disease Safety Pertaining to the Course\nIn consideration of the care and concern for one another and members of our community, unless you are reasonably unable to do so, please take the following steps as a student in this course to mitigate the spread of coronavirus:\nDo not attend class if you have a confirmed case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) until you have fully recovered.\nDo not attend class if you are experiencing any COVID-19 related symptoms as described at this link.\nDo not attend class if you believe that you have been exposed to the coronavirus and might spread it to members of the class. Please visit this link for information on the transmission of the coronavirus.\nWear a CDC approved face covering over your mouth and nose while in the classroom and while visiting the course instructor’s office.\nAttendance\nClass attendance and active participation in class discussion is strongly encouraged. If absence is necessary, please inform the instructor and develop a plan to make up for missing content as soon as possible.\nAssignments and Grading\nGrade Policy\nThe course grade will be based on two in-class exams (totaling 50% and evenly distributed), approximately ten weekly homework assignments (20%), one model report (10%), and a final project (20%).\nGrade Scale\nLetter grades will be assigned based on the following scale:\n\n\nGrade Range\n\n\nLetter Grade\n\n\n94-100\n\n\nA\n\n\n90-93\n\n\nA-\n\n\n87-89\n\n\nB+\n\n\n83-86\n\n\nB\n\n\n80-82\n\n\nB-\n\n\n76-79\n\n\nC+\n\n\n72-75\n\n\nC\n\n\n69-71\n\n\nC-\n\n\n65-68\n\n\nD+\n\n\n60-64\n\n\nD\n\n\n<60\n\n\nF\n\n\nHomework\nThere will be weekly homework assignments. Assignments will be posted on the course learning management system and made up of problems relating to or extending the material covered in class discussions. Working problems is essential to learning the material and doing well on exams.\nDo not underestimate the value (and joy) of carefully working through homework problems.\nExams\nThe in-class exams are meant to assess 1) students’ understanding of the material covered in class and in homework assignments, 2) students’ understanding of the core concepts, 3) students’ problem solving abilities, and 4) students’ ability to think independently. Exam 1 is scheduled for March 2, and Exam 2 is scheduled for May 4. In writing the tests, I assume that you have been studying the material at least 6 hours per week outside of class.\nModel Report\nAs part of the required coursework for Topics in Biomathematics, students are required to submit a model report. The goal of this assignment is for students to read, understand, assess, and explain modeling results from a recently published paper in biomathematics. The model report will make up 10% of the course grade. Students must submit at least two drafts of a model report. A model report should be three-five typed pages and prepared using \\(\\LaTeX\\). The first draft is due March 23 and the final draft is due May 4. A set of guidelines for the model report is posted on the course learning management system.\nFinal Project\nIt should be recognized that the mathematical techniques developed in class are applicable in broader situations than can be covered in lectures and homework. Thus, students are asked to individually explore a topic in biomathematics beyond what is covered in lecture by means of a final project. Final projects should be an 8-12 page manuscript typed using \\(\\LaTeX\\), and students must submit at least two drafts of their written final projects. The final draft is due no later than 5:00pm on Wednesday May 18. All written and presented work must be original, explained in your own words, and use proper citation for works referenced.\nA set of guidelines for the final project is posted on the course learning management system. You must choose a topic for your final project and submit a one to two paragraph description of your proposed project along with at least two scholarly references to me no later than 3:00pm on March 2.\nUse of Digital Technology\nWork and research in Biomathematics requires professionals in the field to make use of digital technology. The primary uses of digital technology in Biomathematics is for producing and importing data, scientific computing, visualization of data and model-based simulations, and preparing written documents to explain mathematical results. Two of the most commonly used technological tools are R for scientific computing and \\(\\LaTeX\\) for written document preparation. Students in this course will be expected to use R, and \\(\\LaTeX\\). R can be installed to any platform via the downloads available here. R is best used with the integrative development environment RStudio which can be installed from here.\nCourse Timeline:\nImportant Dates\n\n\nEvent\n\n\nDate\n\n\nClasses begin\n\n\nWednesday, January 26\n\n\nLast day to add classes\n\n\nTuesday, February 1\n\n\nLast day for 100% tution refund\n\n\nFriday, February 4\n\n\nLast day to drop with no grade\n\n\nFriday February 25\n\n\nExam 1\n\n\nWednesday, March 2\n\n\nSemester Midpoint\n\n\nFriday, March 11\n\n\nLast day of class before spring break\n\n\nFriday, March 11\n\n\nClasses resume after spring break\n\n\nMonday, March 21\n\n\nLast day to withdraw with W grade\n\n\nWednesday, April 13\n\n\nLast day of class before Easter break\n\n\nWednesday, April 13\n\n\nClasses resume after Easter\n\n\nTuesday, April 19\n\n\nExam 2\n\n\nWednesday, May 4\n\n\nLast day of class\n\n\nFriday, May 13\n\n\nFinal exams begin\n\n\nMonday, May 16\n\n\nFinal exams end\n\n\nFriday, May 20\n\n\nWeekly Schedule\nWeek 1: Introduction to Biomathematics\nWeek 2: Basic Biomathematical Workflow\nWeek 3: Introduction to Mathematical Modeling\nWeek 4: Population Models\nWeek 5: Compartment Models\nWeek 6: SIR Type Models\nWeek 7: Exam 1\nWeek 8: The Chemostat Bio-reactor\nWeek 9: Spring Break\nWeek 10: Functional Forms\nWeek 11: Mass Action and Reaction Kinetics\nWeek 12: Dimensional Analysis\nWeek 13: Phase-Plane Methods\nWeek 14: Mathematical Physiology\nWeek 15: Exam 2\nWeek 16: Additional Topics\nWeek 17: Finals Week\nUniversity Resources for Students:\nStudents with Disabilities\nReasonable academic accommodations may be provided to students who submit relevant and current documentation of their disability.

The set of notes to which this document belongs have been developed from a course, MATH 463 Topics in Biomathematics, taught at the University of Scranton since 2013. The purpose of this course is to provide students having a background in linear algebra and differential equations with a grounding in mathematical modeling for biological phenomenon. We hope that these notes may also be useful for a somewhat wider audience of individuals that are interested in mathematical or theoretical biology, or areas of applied mathematics that consider scientific problems from biology or medicine.\nLecture Notes\nThere are several reasons for the existence of these notes. The principal ones are\nto provide a reference that strikes a desired balance between the subjects of mathematics and science,\nto provide a reference that includes discussion of some important topics from mathematical modeling that are relevant in contexts more general than just mathematical biology,\nto provide a reference that helps to bridge the gap that is necessary to close in order to begin reading the research literature, and\nto provide a reference that encourages good work flow practices such as integrating analysis, computing, and the written presentation of results.\nCourse Projects\nWhen teaching MATH 463 Topics in Biomathematics, an important component of the course is student projects. There are two different types of projects that students in Topics in Biomathematics are asked to complete: model reports, and a final independent project. The model reports are meant for students to get early exposure to reading research literature that involves the development or application of mathematical models in biology and medicine. The idea is for students to get experience with the “translation” process of going from a real world biological problem to a mathematical abstraction and back again. Furthermore, students are asked to think and write critically about a mathematical model published in a recent research article. One might reasonably view the model report assignment as asking students to write a peer-review referee report for a manuscript that has already been reviewed and published.\nThe final independent project is meant as a capstone to the course. It is not the expectation that every student will do an entirely original research project that involves developing a novel mathematical model from scratch, although in practice this does occur fairly often. However, the final project requires a more substantial synthesis of scientific and mathematical knowledge and understanding than the model report or other assignments such as homework or written exams.\nThis is all meant to highlight the fact that throughout these set of lecture notes, we have tried to provide pointers to current or at least fairly recent research that is reasonably accessible to the average student in MATH 463 in order to facilitate the model report and final independent projects. Every time we discuss a topic in the notes, we follow the discussion up with specific references where students may go to in order to learn more, acquire project ideas, and see what else is out there regarding mathematical and theoretical biology.\nThe Use of R\nThroughout these notes and the Topics in Biomathematics course we make regular use of the R software and ecosystem for computing. It is impossible to do very much interesting work in science and applied mathematics, including mathematical and theoretical biology, without computation. For the purposes of this course, we will need to employ numerical methods for solving equations, optimization, and linear algebra. In addition, we will find it very helpful to be able to create visualizations that are simple yet professional in appearance. The R environment and language possesses several features that make it highly appropriate for all of these purposes. Among it’s many advantages, R is also freely available.\nIn addition to R, we also use RStudio, an integrated development environment that enhances the use of R. Using RStudio makes it possible to access the Topics in Biomathematics lecture notes in an interactive fashion because all of the notes are written as R Markdown notebooks. This allows us to integrate text, equations, figures, R code, plots, etc. and to compile the result as both html and pdf files. On top of that, students will have a template they can follow in order to write and present their work for the model report and independent final projects.\nWhat is Biomathematics?\nBiomathematics is concerned with the use of mathematical methods (e.g., linear algebra, differential equations, dynamical systems, and probability theory) to understand phenomenon in the life sciences, it is part of the larger field of mathematical and theoretical biology. Mathematical and theoretical biology provide a solid foundation for computational and quantitative approaches to investigations in biology and medicine. The general work flow in biomathematics proceeds as follows:\nStart with some real world phenomenon of interest from the life sciences.\nAbstract from the real world in order to highlight essential features, mechanisms, processes, etc. with the goal of answering some specific question or solving some particular problem. This typically involves making some set of simplifying assumptions about the biological world.\nRepresent your abstraction from step 2 mathematically, say for example as a system of equations. This typically involves the construction of a mathematical model.\nApply rigorous techniques from applied mathematics or scientific computing in order to understand the mathematical representation in step 3 with the goal of using it to solve a problem or answer a question.\nPlace your results from step 4 in the context of the original real world biological phenomenon.\nIt may be necessary to repeat steps 2-5 multiple times with refinements at each iteration in order for your efforts to yield something that is truly useful for addressing a scientific question.\nBiomathematics, which for the purposes of this course we consider synonymous with mathematical biology, emerges as a distinct field due to the fact that carrying out the previously described steps has resulted in the (continuing) development of some common methods and terminology. Furthermore, we carefully distinguish biomathematics from the field of biostatistics. While biomathematics certainly involves the use of probability and statistics, these areas play a different role within biomathematical investigations than they do in biostatistical investigations. Additionally, the relationship between theory and experiment is different in biomathematics than in biostatistics.\nIn the next lecture, we will spend some more time fleshing out the steps of the basic biomathematical workflow. From there, we will begin to examine some general principles related to the construction of mathematical models. That is, we will study those ideas from mathematical modeling that are essential for biomathematics. Our goal is to get to a point where developing a mathematical model and using it to answer some biological question does not seem like an impossible task.\nFurther Reading\nThroughout this course, you are encouraged to look at additional references for the purposes of seeing the perspectives of others and for learning about topics and methods that are not covered explicitly in lectures or assigned reading. The following sections provide an overview of some additional texts you might want to examine at some point.\nBasic Texts in Biomathematics\nSeveral established textbooks in biomathematics are widely available. See for example, (Allen 2007; Britton 2003; de Vries et al. 2006; Edelstein-Keshet 2005; Friedman and Kao 2014; Murray 2002, 2003). The two-volume text by Murray, (Murray 2002, 2003), is considered something of a standard, the books cover a variety of different topics well beyond what we can, but assume a greater mathematical background than we do in this course. There are also several nice sets of lecture notes that are available online for free, such as those by Byrne, Chasnov, Goldstein and Pedley, Ingalls, and Sontag.\nMathematical Population Dynamics\nThe earliest motivations for the development of biomathematics comes from theoretical ecology and population dynamics. A sub-area of these fields is mathematical epidemiology. Excellent references for learning more about these fields are provided by(Brauer and Castillo-Chavez 2012; Kot 2001).\nMathematical Physiology\nMathematical physiology is another large sub-discipline within biomathematics. A standard reference is provided by (Keener and Sneyd 2009b, 2009a). Note that mathematical physiology intersects with biophysics and biochemistry.\nNeuronal Dynamics\nAn important and well-developed topic in mathematical physiology and biophysics is mathematical and computational neuroscience. Excellent references for this field are (Börgers 2017; Ermentrout and Terman 2010). You are also encouraged to watch the videos from two conference talks on Brain Control and Modeling Large Scale Brain Activity.\nMathematical Techniques and Computing\nIn this course, we will primarily use techniques from linear algebra and ordinary differential equations. In much of our study of mathematical models arising in biomathematics, we will be equally interested in qualitative and quantitatve results. The area of applied mathematics known as dynamical systems theory provides the mathematical techniques for a qualitative analysis of mathematical models. During the course, we will need to develop and employ some techniques for differential equations that may not be covered in a first course in ODEs. The following two references may be very helpful in learning more about applied dynamical systems and differential equations as they relate to biomathematics (Jones, Plank, and Sleeman 2010; Strogatz 2015).\nWhen it comes to both the quantitative and qualitative analysis of differential equation models, it is very helpful to do so with the aid of a computer. Both the R language for statistical computing and the Julia language for scientific computing are excellent for our purposes. Each of these has an associated ecosystem with packages that help make mathematical modeling and analysis easier. In this course, we primarily use R because of the phaseR package for the phase-line and phase-plane analysis of one- and two-dimensional systems of differential equations. Furthermore, the notes for this course are written using the RStudio integrated development environment associated with R. Thus, using R and RStudio allows the reader to go through these notes interactively to enhance the learning experience.\nApproaches not Covered in Class\nThere are many different classes of mathematical models and a variety of different approaches to biomathematics. Notably absent from the main discussion in this course is stochastic models (an excellent reference with applications in biology is provided by (Allen 2011)) and game theory.\nResearch in Biomathematics\nBiomathematics and related fields are active areas of research in which there are new peer-reviewed articles appearing on a daily basis. The Society for Mathematical Biology is a great source for information on what is happening in the field of biomathematcs. If you are interested to see what is going on at the cutting edge, you might also want to look at some of the following links:\nJournal of Mathematical Biology\nJournal of Theoretical Biology\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology\nMathematical Biosciences and Engineering\nPLos Computational Biology\narXiv on Quantitative Biology\n\n\n\nAllen, Linda J.

One is an extremely simple example about population growth, while the other is an example from a paper concerned with understanding general features of the inflammatory process (Herald 2010).\nSimple Population Growth\nIndividual organisms typically belong to a population. Understanding the growth of a population is important for understanding the ecology and evolution of organisms. In particular, one may want to know about factors that lead to the extinction of a species. Of course, a population of organisms belongs to an ecosystem in which it interacts with its environment and other species. Before we get carried away and try to understand an entire ecosystem, it is useful to theorize about how a single-species population may change as a function of time.\nConsider a simple isolated and homogeneous population. Let \\(N(t)\\) denote the number (or sometimes density) of individuals in the population at time \\(t\\). For simplicity we will assume that \\(N\\) is a continuous and differentiable function of the continuous variable \\(t\\). Later we will reflect on these assumptions and discuss modifications that could be made if necessary. We define\n\\(\\text{per capita rate of change} = \\frac{1}{N}\\frac{dN}{dt}\\)\nnoting that this quantity has units of \\(\\frac{1}{\\text{time}}\\). The point is that we can arrive at a mathematical model for the growth of a population by specifying a formula for the per capita rate of change. Let’s begin with the simplest assumption that we can possibly make, suppose that the per capita rate of change is constant. That is, suppose\n\\(\\frac{1}{N}\\frac{dN}{dt} = r\\).\nThen,\n\\(\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\\).\nLet’s make two observations about this last equation:\nIf \\(r > 0\\), then \\(rN >0\\) (populations are always positive so we assume implicitly that \\(N > 0\\)) and thus \\(\\frac{dN}{dt} > 0\\). Therefore, if the constant rate \\(r > 0\\), then the population will always be increasing. On the other hand, if \\(r < 0\\), then the population will always be decreasing.\nReflection: Sketch the graph of a function that is always positive and always increasing. Sketch the graph of a function that is always positive and always decreasing.\nGiven an initial value of the population \\(N(0) = N_0\\), \\(N(t) = N_{0}e^{rt}\\) satisfies the differential equation \\(\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\\).\nReflection: Take a moment to verify this by substituting \\(N(t) = N_{0}e^{rt}\\) into both sides of the equation. In the homework you will be asked to derive this solution using the method of separation. (Chances are that you have done this before.)\nLet’s look at the graph of \\(N(t) = N_{0}e^{rt}\\):\n\n\n\nFigure 1:  Exponential growth model results.\n\n\n\n(Note: It is worth the effort to remember forever and all time that the solution of the differential equation\n\\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = ax\\),\nwith initial condition \\(x(0)=x_0\\) is \\(x(t) = x_{0}e^{at}\\).)\nBased on our observations, we see that a population that obeys the model \\(\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\) will grow (if \\(r > 0\\)) or decay (if \\(r < 0\\)) in an exponential fashion.\nAn obvious question is, what determines if \\(r\\) is positive or negative? One way to make sense of this is to think of \\(r\\) as the difference between the per capita birth rate \\(b\\) and the per capita death rate \\(d\\) so that \\(r=b-d\\). Then \\(r > 0\\) if \\(b > d\\) and \\(r < 0\\) if \\(b < d\\). Thus, a population is predicted to go extinct (in the long run as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\)) if the per capita death rate is greater than the per capita birth rate.\nOne problem with the model is that long term exponential growth is unrealistic. The survival of a real population depends on resources such as food and water. An exponentially growing population would soon deplete all available resources. On the other hand, it is not unrealistic for a population to initially grow exponentially when the population numbers are very small relative to the availability of resources. Later on we will discuss ways to adjust the model so that growth is exponential when the population is small but slows as the population increases.\nNotice how we hit each step of the biomathematics work flow during the course of our discussion on population growth. We began with a real world phenomenon, abstracted to an isolated homogeneous population, wrote down a mathematical model, derived information from the model and cast that information in the context of the original real world phenomenon. Let’s look at another example of how the biomathematics work flow plays out in the context of more recent research.\nGeneral Model of Inflammation\nInflammation is a normal part of the immune response for defense against invasion by foreign cells or molecules. However, inflammation may become chronic and lead to disease, sepsis, and even death. For the purposes of both treatment and prevention of disease, it is important to understand the conditions that lead to chronic inflammation.\nWithout going into the biological and chemical details, we know that inflammation is controlled and mediated by immune cells (the macrophage) whose behavior is regulated by signaling molecules known as cytokines. Thus, it is reasonable for the purposes of abstraction to encapsulate the immune response by the activities of macrophage cells, cytokines, and an invading body such as a bacteria cell. This is exactly what is done in the paper (Herald 2010).\nFigure 2 shows a schematic corresponding to our abstraction of the immune response. The macrophage cell population responds to bacterial invasion and produces cytokines that mediate the immune response. The exact details of the interactions are governed by model parameters and mathematical relationships between the interacting cell populations and cytokines.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:  Schematic of inflammation model. This corresponds roughly to Figure 1 in (Herald 2010).\n\n\n\nIn (Herald 2010), the author converts the model diagram into a mathematical model in the form of a coupled system of nonlinear differential equations shown here:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dM}{dt} &= s + \\frac{r C}{1 + k_{1} C} - m_{d} M, \\\\\n\\frac{dC}{dt} &=  p_{c} B M + M \\frac{a C}{(1 + k_{2} C)}\\frac{1}{(1 + k_{3} A)} - c_{d} C,\\\\\n\\frac{dA}{dt} &=  p_{a} C M - a_{d} A, \\\\ \n\\frac{dB}{dt} &= g B - b_{d} M B.\n\\end{align}\\]\nLater on in the course we will study this model in more detail. For now, note that\n\\(M\\) - macrophage cell population\n\\(C\\) - inflammatory cytokine concentration\n\\(A\\) - anti-inflammatory cytokine concentration\n\\(B\\) - bacteria cell population\nIn the paper, the author uses the model equations to show that under a certain set of circumstances a bacterial pathogen will not provide a sufficient trigger to cause chronic inflammation. On the other hand, if conditions are right, even a minor bacterial infection can lead to chronic inflammation. We leave the details of the analysis for later in the course. Notice that this example contains all of the components of the basic biomathematics work flow.\nThe real world phenomenon of interest from the life sciences is inflammation.\nFigure 2 corresponds to an abstraction of the biochemical details of the immune system highlighting what is thought to be the essential features of the inflammatory response.\nClearly there is a mathematical model. A major portion of this course is devoted to understanding how one might come up with such a system of equations. These were not simply pulled out of thin air.\nIn (Herald 2010), the author uses techniques from dynamical systems and bifurcation theory in order to derive useful information from the model equations.\nThe author’s analysis of the model system explains some aspects of inflammation and pinpoints conditions that lead to chronic inflammation. The authors work also explains why certain therapies for chronic inflammation are not successful.\nThere are still many questions about inflammation to be addressed beyond what is done in (Herald 2010). However, in order to make progress more details of the immune response may need to be included. This will involve either modifying the system of equations displayed in this section, or using a different mathematical model altogether. For now, the point to take away is that, often times, this is how work in biomathematics proceeds. In the next lecture, we will start to learn some essential principles of mathematical modeling that will help us to see where equations such as the ones presented in this section come from.\nFurther Reading\nFor those that want to learn more about the topics discussed in this lecture, we provide here some relevant references.\nMathematical Models for Population Growth\nIntroductions to mathematical models for population growth may be found in most of the standard texts in biomathematics. Good places to start are (Allen 2007; Britton 2003; Edelstein-Keshet 2005). The textbook (Kot 2001) is entirely devoted to population models. An important application of population growth models is to cancer biology where one is interested to understand the growth of tumor cell populations. Two papers that examine population growth models in the context of tumor cell growth are (Gerlee 2013; Sarapata and de Pillis 2014).\nMathematical Models of Inflammation\nMathematical modeling of inflammation is an area of current research.
