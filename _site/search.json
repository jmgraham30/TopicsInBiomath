In order to fulfill the learning objectives for EPW Level II students will be asked to complete two writing intensive assignments. These are\na model report assignment,\nand a final project.\nDetails for these assignments are described below and additional guidelines are posted on thee course learning management system.\nCourse Policies and Procedures:\nCoronavirus Disease Safety Pertaining to the Course\nIn consideration of the care and concern for one another and members of our community, unless you are reasonably unable to do so, please take the following steps as a student in this course to mitigate the spread of coronavirus:\nDo not attend class if you have a confirmed case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) until you have fully recovered.\nDo not attend class if you are experiencing any COVID-19 related symptoms as described at this link.\nDo not attend class if you believe that you have been exposed to the coronavirus and might spread it to members of the class. Please visit this link for information on the transmission of the coronavirus.\nWear a CDC approved face covering over your mouth and nose while in the classroom and while visiting the course instructor’s office.\nAttendance\nClass attendance and active participation in class discussion is strongly encouraged. If absence is necessary, please inform the instructor and develop a plan to make up for missing content as soon as possible.\nAssignments and Grading\nGrade Policy\nThe course grade will be based on two in-class exams (totaling 50% and evenly distributed), approximately ten weekly homework assignments (20%), one model report (10%), and a final project (20%).\nGrade Scale\nLetter grades will be assigned based on the following scale:\n\n\nGrade Range\n\n\nLetter Grade\n\n\n94-100\n\n\nA\n\n\n90-93\n\n\nA-\n\n\n87-89\n\n\nB+\n\n\n83-86\n\n\nB\n\n\n80-82\n\n\nB-\n\n\n76-79\n\n\nC+\n\n\n72-75\n\n\nC\n\n\n69-71\n\n\nC-\n\n\n65-68\n\n\nD+\n\n\n60-64\n\n\nD\n\n\n<60\n\n\nF\n\n\nHomework\nThere will be weekly homework assignments. Assignments will be posted on the course learning management system and made up of problems relating to or extending the material covered in class discussions. Working problems is essential to learning the material and doing well on exams.\nDo not underestimate the value (and joy) of carefully working through homework problems.\nExams\nThe in-class exams are meant to assess 1) students’ understanding of the material covered in class and in homework assignments, 2) students’ understanding of the core concepts, 3) students’ problem solving abilities, and 4) students’ ability to think independently. Exam 1 is scheduled for March 2, and Exam 2 is scheduled for May 4. In writing the tests, I assume that you have been studying the material at least 6 hours per week outside of class.\nModel Report\nAs part of the required coursework for Topics in Biomathematics, students are required to submit a model report. The goal of this assignment is for students to read, understand, assess, and explain modeling results from a recently published paper in biomathematics. The model report will make up 10% of the course grade. Students must submit at least two drafts of a model report. A model report should be three-five typed pages and prepared using \\(\\LaTeX\\). The first draft is due March 23 and the final draft is due May 4. A set of guidelines for the model report is posted on the course learning management system.\nFinal Project\nIt should be recognized that the mathematical techniques developed in class are applicable in broader situations than can be covered in lectures and homework. Thus, students are asked to individually explore a topic in biomathematics beyond what is covered in lecture by means of a final project. Final projects should be an 8-12 page manuscript typed using \\(\\LaTeX\\), and students must submit at least two drafts of their written final projects. The final draft is due no later than 5:00pm on Wednesday May 18. All written and presented work must be original, explained in your own words, and use proper citation for works referenced.\nA set of guidelines for the final project is posted on the course learning management system. You must choose a topic for your final project and submit a one to two paragraph description of your proposed project along with at least two scholarly references to me no later than 3:00pm on March 2.\nUse of Digital Technology\nWork and research in Biomathematics requires professionals in the field to make use of digital technology. The primary uses of digital technology in Biomathematics is for producing and importing data, scientific computing, visualization of data and model-based simulations, and preparing written documents to explain mathematical results. Two of the most commonly used technological tools are R for scientific computing and \\(\\LaTeX\\) for written document preparation. Students in this course will be expected to use R, and \\(\\LaTeX\\). R can be installed to any platform via the downloads available here. R is best used with the integrative development environment RStudio which can be installed from here.\nCourse Timeline:\nImportant Dates\n\n\nEvent\n\n\nDate\n\n\nClasses begin\n\n\nWednesday, January 26\n\n\nLast day to add classes\n\n\nTuesday, February 1\n\n\nLast day for 100% tution refund\n\n\nFriday, February 4\n\n\nLast day to drop with no grade\n\n\nFriday February 25\n\n\nExam 1\n\n\nWednesday, March 2\n\n\nSemester Midpoint\n\n\nFriday, March 11\n\n\nLast day of class before spring break\n\n\nFriday, March 11\n\n\nClasses resume after spring break\n\n\nMonday, March 21\n\n\nLast day to withdraw with W grade\n\n\nWednesday, April 13\n\n\nLast day of class before Easter break\n\n\nWednesday, April 13\n\n\nClasses resume after Easter\n\n\nTuesday, April 19\n\n\nExam 2\n\n\nWednesday, May 4\n\n\nLast day of class\n\n\nFriday, May 13\n\n\nFinal exams begin\n\n\nMonday, May 16\n\n\nFinal exams end\n\n\nFriday, May 20\n\n\nWeekly Schedule\nWeek 1: Introduction to Biomathematics\nWeek 2: Basic Biomathematical Workflow\nWeek 3: Introduction to Mathematical Modeling\nWeek 4: Population Models\nWeek 5: Compartment Models\nWeek 6: SIR Type Models\nWeek 7: Exam 1\nWeek 8: The Chemostat Bio-reactor\nWeek 9: Spring Break\nWeek 10: Functional Forms\nWeek 11: Mass Action and Reaction Kinetics\nWeek 12: Dimensional Analysis\nWeek 13: Phase-Plane Methods\nWeek 14: Mathematical Physiology\nWeek 15: Exam 2\nWeek 16: Additional Topics\nWeek 17: Finals Week\nUniversity Resources for Students:\nStudents with Disabilities\nReasonable academic accommodations may be provided to students who submit relevant and current documentation of their disability.

I am here to assist you with your work in this course. Additionally, if you come to me with other non-course-related concerns, I will do my best to help. It is important for you to know that all faculty members are required to report incidents of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct involving students. This means that I cannot keep information about sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, intimate partner violence or stalking confidential if you share that information with me. I will keep the information as private as I can but am required to bring it to the attention of the University’s Title IX Coordinator, Elizabeth M. Garcia, or Deputy Title IX Coordinator, Christine M. Black, who, in conversation with you, will explain available support, resources, and options. I will not report anything to anybody without first letting you know and discussing choices as to how to proceed. The University’s Counseling Center (570-941-7620) is available to you as a confidential resource; counselors (in the counseling center) do not have an obligation to report to the Title IX Coordinator.\nNon-discrimination Statement\nThe University is committed to providing an educational, residential, and working environment that is free from harassment and discrimination.

All reporting options and resources are available at https://www.scranton.edu/CARE.\nAbout Pronouns\nIt is easy to make assumptions about what pronouns people prefer, but we try not to! Please tell us in class or via a private email if you would like to let us know what your pronouns are, if/when you would like us (and others) to use them, and certainly feel free to correct us or others if we make a mistake. Using the pronouns that a person has indicated they prefer is considered both professional and polite, and as such we ask that all members of our class use the appropriate pronouns.\nIf you have questions about this, please feel free to look up more information here (https://www.mypronouns.org/) or email jason.graham@scranton.edu with any questions.\nAcademic Honesty and Integrity\nEach student is expected to do their own work. It is also expected that each student respect and abide by the Academic Code of Honesty as set forth in the University of Scranton student handbook. Conduct that violates the Academic Code of Honesty includes plagiarism, duplicate submission of the same work, collusion, providing false information, unauthorized use of computers, theft and destruction of property, and unauthorized possession of tests and other materials. Steps taken in response to suspected violations may include a discussion with the instructor, an informal meeting with the dean of the college, and a hearing before the Academic Dishonesty Hearing Board. Students who are found to have violated the Code will ordinarily be assigned the grade F by the instructor and may face other sanctions. The complete Academic Code of Honesty is located on the University website at https://www.scranton.edu/academics/wml/acad-integ/acad-code-honesty.shtml.\nFinal Note\nThe instructor reserves the right to modify this syllabus; students will immediately be notified of any such changes and an updated syllabus will be made available to the class via the course learning management system.\n\n\n\n",
