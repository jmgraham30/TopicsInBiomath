This is the same as estimating\nthe slope and intercept parameters in an equation for a line given data\npoints that you want the line to “pass through.”\nLine Fitting\nSuppose we have some number \\(n\\)\ndata points \\((x_{1},y_{1})\\), \\((x_{2},y_{2})\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\((x_{n},y_{n})\\). If these data points all\nlie on the same line, then it is trivial to fit a line through them\nbecause any two colinear points uniquely determine a line, and it’s\nequation is found in the usual pre-calculus way using the formula for\nslope and intercept.\nHowever, real data never falls exactly on a perfect line even if the\nunderlying relationship is linear. There is always measurement error or\nnoise associated with real data. Suppose our data looks as follows:\n\n\nShow code\n\nset.seed(1234)\nx <- sort(runif(15,0,4))\ny <- 2*x + 3 + rnorm(15,0.25)\nmy_data <- tibble(x=x,y=y)\nmy_data %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n  geom_point() +  \n  theme(text = element_text(size = 15))\n\n\n\n\nIt is not unreasonable to try to model this data with a linear\nrelationship. In fact, here is the “best-fit” line for this data:\n\n\nShow code\n\nmy_data %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n  geom_point() +  \n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\",se=FALSE) + \n  theme(text = element_text(size = 15))\n\n\n\n\nWhat we want to explain is how this line is determined. Every\n(non-vertical) line in the plan is determined by two parameters, the\nslope \\(a_{1}\\) and the intercept \\(a_{0}\\). The best-fit line is the one that\nminimizes the sum of squares errors (SSE)\n\\[\\text{SSE}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i}-\\hat{y}_{i})^2,\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{y}_{i}=a_{1}x_{i}+a_{0}\\). The point\nis that we can think of the sum of square errors as a function of the\ntwo variables \\(a_0\\) and \\(a_1\\). Then, the best-fit line is the one\nwith the slope and intercept values that minimizes the SSE. We can\n(numerically) solve a minimization problem in R using the\noptim function in R.\n\nThere are also a number of other functions and packages available for\nsolving optimization problems in R. Which one to use depends on your\nparticular application. We use optim because it is the\nprimary option in base R.\nHere is the relevant R code:\n\n\n# define function to compute SSE\nSSE <- function(A,data=my_data){\n  y_hat <- A[1] + A[2]*data$x\n  sse <- sum((data$y-y_hat)^2) \n}\n# call optim to minimize SSE, requires an initial guess\n(parms <- optim(c(1,1),SSE)$par)\n\n\n[1] 2.829051 2.171718\n\nThis tells us that our data is best modeled by a linear equation with\nslope 2.171718 and intercept 2.8290509. Let’s see this in another\nplot:\n\n\n\nHere the dashed black line is the line with slope 2.171718 and\nintercept 2.8290509. It perfectly matches what we previously stated was\nthe best fit line.\nAnother approach to finding the slope and intercept parameters for a\nbest-fit line in R is by using the lm (short for linear\nmodel) function in R as follows:\n\n\nlm(y~x,data=my_data)$coefficients\n\n\n(Intercept)           x \n   2.828567    2.172016 \n\nNotice that we obtain the same answer as before.\nParameter Estimation\nOur discussion so far provides a very simple example of the general\nand common problem of parameter estimation. That is, given data and a\nmathematical model, what are the parameter values for the model that\nbest fit the data. To solve this problem one tries to do the same thing\nthat we have done here with our best-fit line. That is, minimize the\nerror as a function of the parameter values. The problem is that as the\nmathematical model we are trying to use becomes more complication, say\nfor example a large system of differential equations, the more nonlinear\nthe error becomes as a function of the parameters. Minimizing highly\nnonlinear functions is difficult because there may be multiple and even\nmany local minimum where the optimization algorithm can get stuck. Thus,\nparameter estimation in biomathematics is an active area of current\nresearch.\n\n\n\n",

This states that if\n\\(f\\) is a continuously differentiable\nfunction at \\(x^{\\ast}\\), then\n\\(f'(x^{\\ast}) < 0\\)\nimplies \\(x^{\\ast}\\) is stable,\nwhile\n\\(f'(x^{\\ast}) > 0\\)\nimplies \\(x^{\\ast}\\) is\nunstable.\nIn this post, we provide an explanation for the above stated\nfact.\nLinear Stability Analysis\nConsider the effect of a small perturbation to an equilibrium. Let\n\\(\\xi(t) = x(t) - x^{\\ast}\\) be a small\nperturbation away from \\(x^{\\ast}\\).\nThen by taking the derivative with respect to \\(t\\) on both sides of the equality, we see\nthat\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\xi &= \\frac{d}{dt}(x - x^{\\ast}) \\\\\n&= \\frac{d}{dt}x - \\frac{d}{dt}x^{\\ast} \\\\\n&= \\frac{dx}{dt} - 0 \\\\\n&= f(x) \\\\\n&= f(\\xi + x^{\\ast})\n\\end{align}\\]\nand therefore\n\\(\\frac{d\\xi}{dt}=f(\\xi +\nx^{\\ast})\\)\nNow Taylor’s\nformula leads to\n\\(f(\\xi + x^{\\ast}) = f(x^{\\ast}) +\nf'(x^{\\ast})\\xi + \\mathcal{O}(\\xi^2)\\)\nand thus\n\\(\\frac{d\\xi}{dt} \\approx\nf'(x^{\\ast})\\xi\\)\nwhere we have used the fact that \\(f(x^{\\ast})=0\\).\nRecall that a first-order linear system has the form\n\\(\\frac{dx}{dt}=ax\\)\nand the general solution to such a linear system is \\(x(t)=Ce^{at}\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant. Thus, we see that a\nsolution to a first-order linear system will asymptotically decay if the\ncoefficient \\(a\\) is negative, but grow\nif the coefficient \\(a\\) is\npositive.\nNow, observe that, based on our derivation, the differential equation\nfor a small perturbation \\(\\xi(t)\\)\nsuch as we have defined it very nearly satisfies a first-order linear\nsystem with coefficient \\(f'(x^{\\ast})\\). So, we expect that the\neffect of a perturbation will asymptotically decay if \\(f'(x^{\\ast}) < 0\\) but\nasymptotically increase if \\(f'(x^{\\ast})\n> 0\\). This helps to explain our criterion for stability.\nIt is important to note that our criterion provides no information\nwhen \\(f'(x^{\\ast})=0\\). In fact,\none can easily construct examples of systems that have a stable\nequilibrium such that \\(f'(x^{\\ast})=0\\) and also systems with\nan equilibrium satisfying \\(f'(x^{\\ast})=0\\) that is not stable. It\nis instructive to quickly draw the phase lines for each of the following\nsystems:\n\\(\\frac{dx}{dt}=-x^2\\),\nand\n\\(\\frac{dx}{dt}=-x^3\\).\nOne can conduct a more careful analysis of stability than what we\nhave done here. However, this requires more advanced mathematics than is\nappropriate in the context of the Topics in Biomathematics\ncourse.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nOverview\nA common problem is the following:\n\nGiven a continuous function \\(f\\)\ndefined on the real numbers, find values such that \\(f(x)=0\\).\n\nThis is called the root finding problem. It comes up, for example, in\nfinding the equilibrium or steady-state solutions for a one-dimensional\nautonomous system. Note that the roots of a function \\(y=f(x)\\) coincide exactly with the \\(x\\)-intercepts of the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\). In general, when \\(f\\) is a nonlinear function, the root\nfinding problem is intractable in terms of finding exact, closed-form\nsolutions. However, algorithms for finding approximate solutions to the\nroot finding problem is a major theme in numerical\nanalysis.\nIn this post, we discuss practical numerical root-finding by way of\nthe R package rootSolve.\nThe documentation for this package is available here.\nPractical Root-Finding\nSuppose we would like to find the equilibria for the one-dimensional\nautonomous system\n\\(\\frac{dx}{dt}=f(x) = x^2 - 1\\)\nWhile it’s obvious what the answer is, let us address the problem\ncomputationally for illustrative purposes. We begin by plotting the\nfunction \\(y=f(x)\\) in order to check\nfor the existence of roots “by inspection.”\n\n\n\nThe graph tells us that there are two roots in the interval \\([-2,2]\\). Let’s call the function\nuniroot.all from rootSolve:\n\n\nuniroot.all(function(x){x^2-1}, c(-2, 2))\n\n\n[1] -1  1\n\nNotice that this in fact returns the roots for \\(f(x)=x^2-1\\).\nWhat uniroot.all attempts to do is to find all of the\nroots in the specified interval. Thus, this provides a handy tool for\nfinding equillbria for one-dimensional autonomous systems.\nThe rootSolve package is by no means the only option for\nnumerical root-finding in R. We choose to highlight it as it is\ndeveloped by the group that developed the deSolve package\nfor the numerical approximation for differential equations.\n\n\n\n",
