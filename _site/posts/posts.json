    "contents": "\nOverview\nIn section 5\nof our notes, we discussed an analytic criterion for the stability of a\nsteady-state (or equilibrium) \\(x^{\\ast}\\) corresponding to a\none-dimensional autonomous system \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}=f(x)\\). This states that if\n\\(f\\) is a continuously differentiable\nfunction at \\(x^{\\ast}\\), then\n\\(f'(x^{\\ast}) < 0\\)\nimplies \\(x^{\\ast}\\) is stable,\nwhile\n\\(f'(x^{\\ast}) > 0\\)\nimplies \\(x^{\\ast}\\) is\nunstable.\nIn this post, we provide an explanation for the above stated\nfact.\nLinear Stability Analysis\nConsider the effect of a small perturbation to an equilibrium. Let\n\\(\\xi(t) = x(t) - x^{\\ast}\\) be a small\nperturbation away from \\(x^{\\ast}\\).\nThen by taking the derivative with respect to \\(t\\) on both sides of the equality, we see\nthat\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\xi &= \\frac{d}{dt}(x - x^{\\ast}) \\\\\n&= \\frac{d}{dt}x - \\frac{d}{dt}x^{\\ast} \\\\\n&= \\frac{dx}{dt} - 0 \\\\\n&= f(x) \\\\\n&= f(\\xi + x^{\\ast})\n\\end{align}\\]\nand therefore\n\\(\\frac{d\\xi}{dt}=f(\\xi +\nx^{\\ast})\\)\nNow Taylor’s\nformula leads to\n\\(f(\\xi + x^{\\ast}) = f(x^{\\ast}) +\nf'(x^{\\ast})\\xi + \\mathcal{O}(\\xi^2)\\)\nand thus\n\\(\\frac{d\\xi}{dt} \\approx\nf'(x^{\\ast})\\xi\\)\nwhere we have used the fact that \\(f(x^{\\ast})=0\\).\nRecall that a first-order linear system has the form\n\\(\\frac{dx}{dt}=ax\\)\nand the general solution to such a linear system is \\(x(t)=Ce^{at}\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant. Thus, we see that a\nsolution to a first-order linear system will asymptotically decay if the\ncoefficient \\(a\\) is negative, but grow\nif the coefficient \\(a\\) is\npositive.\nNow, observe that, based on our derivation, the differential equation\nfor a small perturbation \\(\\xi(t)\\)\nsuch as we have defined it very nearly satisfies a first-order linear\nsystem with coefficient \\(f'(x^{\\ast})\\). So, we expect that the\neffect of a perturbation will asymptotically decay if \\(f'(x^{\\ast}) < 0\\) but\nasymptotically increase if \\(f'(x^{\\ast})\n> 0\\). This helps to explain our criterion for stability.\nIt is important to note that our criterion provides no information\nwhen \\(f'(x^{\\ast})=0\\). In fact,\none can easily construct examples of systems that have a stable\nequilibrium such that \\(f'(x^{\\ast})=0\\) and also systems with\nan equilibrium satisfying \\(f'(x^{\\ast})=0\\) that is not stable. It\nis instructive to quickly draw the phase lines for each of the following\nsystems:\n\\(\\frac{dx}{dt}=-x^2\\),\nand\n\\(\\frac{dx}{dt}=-x^3\\).\nOne can conduct a more careful analysis of stability than what we\nhave done here. However, this requires more advanced mathematics than is\nappropriate in the context of the Topics in Biomathematics\ncourse.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nOverview\nA common problem is the following:\n\nGiven a continuous function \\(f\\)\ndefined on the real numbers, find values such that \\(f(x)=0\\).\n\nThis is called the root finding problem. It comes up, for example, in\nfinding the equilibrium or steady-state solutions for a one-dimensional\nautonomous system. Note that the roots of a function \\(y=f(x)\\) coincide exactly with the \\(x\\)-intercepts of the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\). In general, when \\(f\\) is a nonlinear function, the root\nfinding problem is intractable in terms of finding exact, closed-form\nsolutions. However, algorithms for finding approximate solutions to the\nroot finding problem is a major theme in numerical\nanalysis.\nIn this post, we discuss practical numerical root-finding by way of\nthe R package rootSolve.\nThe documentation for this package is available here.\nPractical Root-Finding\nSuppose we would like to find the equilibria for the one-dimensional\nautonomous system\n\\(\\frac{dx}{dt}=f(x) = x^2 - 1\\)\nWhile it’s obvious what the answer is, let us address the problem\ncomputationally for illustrative purposes. We begin by plotting the\nfunction \\(y=f(x)\\) in order to check\nfor the existence of roots “by inspection.”\n\n\n\nThe graph tells us that there are two roots in the interval \\([-2,2]\\). Let’s call the function\nuniroot.all from rootSolve:\n\n\nuniroot.all(function(x){x^2-1}, c(-2, 2))\n\n\n[1] -1  1\n\nNotice that this in fact returns the roots for \\(f(x)=x^2-1\\).\nWhat uniroot.all attempts to do is to find all of the\nroots in the specified interval. Thus, this provides a handy tool for\nfinding equillbria for one-dimensional autonomous systems.\nThe rootSolve package is by no means the only option for\nnumerical root-finding in R. We choose to highlight it as it is\ndeveloped by the group that developed the deSolve package\nfor the numerical approximation for differential equations.\n\n\n\n",
