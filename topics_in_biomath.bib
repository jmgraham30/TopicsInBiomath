  abstract = {This book is designed to be a practical study in infectious disease dynamics. The book offers an easy to follow implementation and analysis of mathematical epidemiology. The book focuses on recent case studies in order to explore various conceptual, mathematical, and statistical issues. The dynamics of infectious diseases shows a wide diversity of pattern. Some have locally persistent chains-of-transmission, others persist spatially in ‘consumer-resource metapopulations’. Some infections are prevalent among the young, some among the old and some are age-invariant. Temporally, some diseases have little variation in prevalence, some have predictable seasonal shifts and others exhibit violent epidemics that may be regular or irregular in their timing. Models and ‘models-with-data’ have proved invaluable for understanding and predicting this diversity, and thence help improve intervention and control. Using mathematical models to understand infectious disease dynamics has a very rich history in epidemiology. The field has seen broad expansions of theories as well as a surge in real-life application of mathematics to dynamics and control of infectious disease. The chapters of Epidemics: Models and Data using R have been organized in a reasonably logical way: Chapters 1-10 is a mix and match of models, data and statistics pertaining to local disease dynamics; Chapters 11-13 pertains to spatial and spatiotemporal dynamics; Chapter 14 highlights similarities between the dynamics of infectious disease and parasitoid-host dynamics; Finally, Chapters 15 and 16 overview additional statistical methodology useful in studies of infectious disease dynamics. This book can be used as a guide for working with data, models and ‘models-and-data’ to understand epidemics and infectious disease dynamics in space and time.},

Individuals with different thresholds respond differently to task-associated stimuli. Low-threshold individuals become involved at a lower level of stimulus than high-threshold individuals. We show that this simple model can account for experimental observations of Wilson (1984), extend the model to more complicated situations, explore its properties, and study under what conditions it can account for temporal polyethism. c ○ 1998 Society for Mathematical Biology 1.},

  abstract = {Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic is a potential cause of carcinogenesis. It elicits its potential by generation of ROS, leading to DNA, protein and lipid damage. Therefore, the deleterious effect of arsenic can be mitigated by quenching ROS using antioxidants. There is a homology between the protein coding regions of mice and human. Effect of these alterations in human can be mimicked in mice. Therefore to understand the underlying mechanism of arsenic toxicity and its amelioration by black tea, studies have been conducted in mice model. Long term exposure to iAs leads to tumour growth, which has been found to be alleviated by black tea. Observations reveal that black tea has two salutary effects on the growth of tumour: the rate of growth of damaged cells was appreciably reduced and an early saturation of the level of damage is achieved. To take the experimental findings further, the experimental data have been modelled with simple dynamical equations. The curves obtained from \textbackslash textit\{in vivo\} studies have been fitted with the data obtained from the model. The corresponding steady states and their stabilities are analyzed.},

Analysis of the steady states yields parameter regions corresponding to regimes of normal clearance of viral infection, chronic infection, or autoimmune behavior, and the boundaries of stability and bifurcations of relevant steady states are found in terms of system parameters. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate different dynamical scenarios, and to identify basins of attraction of different steady states and periodic solutions, highlighting the important role played by the initial conditions in determining the outcome of immune interactions.},

  abstract = {The interaction between aphids, ants and ladybirds has been investigated from an ecological point of view since many decades, while there are no attempts to describe it from a mathematical point of view. This paper introduces a new mathematical model to describe the within-season population dynamics in an ecological patch of a system composed by aphids, ants and ladybirds, through a set of four differential equations. The proposed model is based on the Kindlmann and Dixon set of differential equations, focused on the prediction of the aphids-ladybirds population densities, that share a prey-predator relationship. The population of ants, in mutualistic relationship with aphids and in interspecific competition with ladybirds, is described according to the Holland and De Angelis mathematical model, in which the authors faced the problem of mutualistic interactions in general terms. The set of differential equations proposed here is discretized by means the Nonstandard Finite Difference scheme, successfully applied by Gabbriellini to the mutualistic model. The constructed finite-difference scheme is positivity-preserving and characterized by four nonhyperbolic steady-states, as highlighted by the phase-space and time-series analyses. Particular attention is dedicated to the steady-state most interesting from an ecological point of view, whose asymptotic stability is demonstrated via the Centre Manifold Theory. The model allows to numerically confirm that mutualistic relationship effectively influences the population dynamic, by increasing the peaks of the aphids and ants population densities. Nonetheless, it is showed that the asymptotical populations of aphids and ladybirds collapse for any initial condition, unlike that of ants that, after the peak, settle on a constant asymptotic value.},

These models are usually formulated in terms of differential equations that relate the growth rate of the tumor to its current state and range from the simple one-parameter exponential growth model to more advanced models that contain a large number of parameters. Understanding the assumptions and consequences of such models is important, as they often underpin more complex models of tumor growth. The conclusion of this brief survey is that although much improvement has occurred over the last century, more effort and new models are required if we are to understand the intricacies of tumor growth.

  abstract = {In this investigation we study the effects of climate change on predator-prey population dynamics. The interaction of predator and prey is described by the Variable Territory (VT) model with Allee effects in an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) framework. Climate influence is modeled in this ODE framework as an exogenous driver which affects the prey growth rate. Mathematically, this exogenous driver is a function of time, the climate function, that describes how favorable is the climate, on a scale from \$-1\$ to \$+1\$. Climate change has a number of effects; in this work, we focus on changes in climate variability, in particular, a decrease in the switching rate between good years and bad. With regard to the predator-prey populations, we focus on the conditions that lead to extinction. We developed a high performance software tool to allow the systematic exploration of a wide range of climate scenarios at a high level of detail. Our results show that the predator-prey system is sensitive to the rapid drop in growth rate that accompanies a switch from good growth years to bad growth years. The amplitude of this negative variation as well as its duration are key factors, but more importantly, it is the moment when this negative change occurs during the predator-prey cycle that is critical for the survival of the species.},

  abstract = {Since 2006 the rate of honey bee colony failure has increased significantly. As an aid to testing hypotheses for the causes of colony failure we have developed a compartment model of honey bee colony population dynamics to explore the impact of different death rates of forager bees on colony growth and development. The model predicts a critical threshold forager death rate beneath which colonies regulate a stable population size. If death rates are sustained higher than this threshold rapid population decline is predicted and colony failure is inevitable. The model also predicts that high forager death rates draw hive bees into the foraging population at much younger ages than normal, which acts to accelerate colony failure. The model suggests that colony failure can be understood in terms of observed principles of honey bee population dynamics, and provides a theoretical framework for experimental investigation of the problem.},

CD4+ T cells, the cells that orchestrate the immune response, use these cytokines as signaling mechanisms for immune-response stimulation as well as lymphocyte stimulation, growth, and differentiation. Because tumor cells begin as ‘self’, the immune system may not respond in an effective way to eradicate them. Adoptive cellular immunotherapy can potentially restore or enhance these effects. We illustrate through mathematical modeling the dynamics between tumor cells, immune-effector cells, and IL-2. These efforts are able to explain both short tumor oscillations in tumor sizes as well as long-term tumor relapse. We then explore the effects of adoptive cellular immunotherapy on the model and describe under what circumstances the tumor can be eliminated.},

  abstract = {Infections with Sarcoptes scabiei, or scabies, remain common in many disadvantaged populations. Mass drug administration (MDA) has been used in such settings to achieve a rapid reduction in infection and transmission, with the goal of eliminating the public health burden of scabies. While prevalence has been observed to fall substantially following such an intervention, in some instances resurgence of infection to baseline levels has occurred over several years. To explore the biology underpinning this phenomenon, we have developed a theoretical model of scabies life-cycle and transmission dynamics in a homogeneously mixing population, and simulate the impact of mass drug treatment strategies acting on egg and mite life cycle stages (ovicidal) or mites alone (non-ovicidal). In order to investigate the dynamics of the system, we first define and calculate the optimal interval between treatment doses. We calculate the probability of eradication as a function of the number of optimally-timed successive treatment doses and the number of years over which a program is run. For the non-ovicidal intervention, we first show that at least two optimally-timed doses are required to achieve eradication. We then demonstrate that while more doses over a small number of years provides the highest chance of eradication, a similar outcome can be achieved with fewer doses delivered annually over a longer period of time. For the ovicidal intervention, we find that doses should be delivered as close together as possible. This work provides a platform for further research into optimal treatment strategies which may incorporate heterogeneity of transmission, and the interplay between MDA and enhancement of continuing scabies surveillance and treatment strategies.},

Nutrient fluctuations are important for evolutionary and ecological dynamics in microbial communities since they impact growth rates, population sizes, and biofilm formation. Here we use automated continuous-culture devices and high-throughput imaging to show that when populations of Escherichia coli are subjected to cycles of nutrient excess (feasts) and scarcity (famine) their abundance dynamics during famines depend on the frequency and amplitude of feasts. We show that frequency and amplitude dependent dynamics in planktonic populations arise from nutrient and history dependent rates of aggregation and dispersal. A phenomenological model recapitulates our experimental observations. Our results show that the statistical properties of environmental fluctuations have substantial impacts on spatial structure in bacterial populations driving large changes in abundance dynamics.},

A number of solid tumors contain a high proportion of macrophages and these immune cells are known to have a remarkable impact on the progression and dormancy of such tumors. We assume these macrophages as the main immune system component facilitating tumor destruction. Stability criteria of the basic model around the steady state of coexistence are derived. Next, we consider the process of macrophage activation as non-instantaneous by using a distributed delay with a weak kernel and obtain a range for the macrophage death rate that ensures system stability. Finally, we incorporate the spatial irregularity of solid tumors by making the delay nonlocal. Analysis of the resulting spatiotemporal model gives a number of thresholds in terms of different system parameters that guarantee tumor stability. Numerical simulations are performed to justify analytical findings.},

  abstract = {We studied the formation of trail patterns by Argentine ants exploring an empty arena. Using a novel imaging and analysis technique we estimated pheromone concentrations at all spatial positions in the experimental arena and at different times. Then we derived the response function of individual ants to pheromone concentrations by looking at correlations between concentrations and changes in speed or direction of the ants. Ants were found to turn in response to local pheromone concentrations, while their speed was largely unaffected by these concentrations. Ants did not integrate pheromone concentrations over time, with the concentration of pheromone in a 1 cm radius in front of the ant determining the turning angle. The response to pheromone was found to follow a Weber's Law, such that the difference between quantities of pheromone on the two sides of the ant divided by their sum determines the magnitude of the turning angle. This proportional response is in apparent contradiction with the well-established non-linear choice function used in the literature to model the results of binary bridge experiments in ant colonies (Deneubourg et al. 1990). However, agent based simulations implementing the Weber's Law response function led to the formation of trails and reproduced results reported in the literature. We show analytically that a sigmoidal response, analogous to that in the classical Deneubourg model for collective decision making, can be derived from the individual Weber-type response to pheromone concentrations that we have established in our experiments when directional noise around the preferred direction of movement of the ants is assumed.},
