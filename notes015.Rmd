# Goals

After reading this section of notes, you should

1) know what is a first-order nonlinear difference equation, 

2) know the procedure for determining fixed-points for first-order nonlinear difference equations, and

3) know how to use both graphical and analytical techniques for examining the stability properties of fixed-points for first-order nonlinear difference equations.
