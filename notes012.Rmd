# Goals

After reading this section of notes, you should

1) be able to conduct a linear stability analysis for a nonlinear autonomous system, 

2) know how to use `phaseR` to obtain phase-portraits for two-dimensional nonlinear systems, and

3) know how to compute numerical solutions for initial value problems for nonlinear systems using `deSolve`.


# Background

Previously, we have reviewed mathematical techniques for the analysis of one-dimensional autonomous systems and linear systems. In this section, we consider the analogous techniques for nonlinear autonomous systems of the form

$$
\frac{d}{dt}{\bf x} = {\bf F}({\bf x})
$$

where ${\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and ${\bf F}:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$. Such a system is sometimes called a **nonlinear vector field**. 

We have already encountered some nonlinear autonomous systems as mathematical models. For example, the predator-prey model, SIR model, and chemostat model are all nonlinear autonomous systems. 

## Equilibria for Nonlinear Systems

If $\frac{d}{dt}{\bf x} = {\bf F}({\bf x})$ is a nonlinear autonomous system, then we say that a vector ${\bf x}^{\ast}$ is an **equilibrium** if it satisfies ${\bf F}({\bf x}^{\ast}) = {\bf 0}$. A typical problem is to determine the stability properties of equilibria for nonlinear systems. In general this can be a difficult problem. However, in some cases when can use linearization to say something about the stability of equilibria. We begin by reviewing this technique in the two-dimensional case. 

# Two-Dimensional Case

We can write a two-dimensional nonlinear autonomous system as

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= f(x,y) \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= g(x,y)
\end{align*}
$$

Then an equilibrium is a point $(x^{\ast},y^{\ast})$ satisfying the simultaneous system

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x^{\ast},y^{\ast}) &= 0 \\
g(x^{\ast},y^{\ast}) &= 0 
\end{align*}
$$

For example, the system

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= 2x - 3xy \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= xy - 4y
\end{align*}
$$

has two equilibria, $(0,0)$ and $(4,\frac{3}{2})$.  

If $(x^{\ast},y^{\ast})$ is an equilibrium point for a two-dimensional nonlinear autonomous system, then we call the matrix

$$
J_{(x^{\ast},y^{\ast})} = \left(\begin{array}{cc} f_{x}(x^{\ast},y^{\ast}) & f_{y}(x^{\ast},y^{\ast}) \\ g_{x}(x^{\ast},y^{\ast}) & g_{y}(x^{\ast},y^{\ast}) \end{array} \right)
$$

**the linearization** of the system at the equilibrium $(x^{\ast},y^{\ast})$. It turns out that in some cases, the linearization can be used to determine the stability of the equilibrium $(x^{\ast},y^{\ast})$. Specifically, if the eigenvalues of $J_{(x^{\ast},y^{\ast})}$ have **nonzero real part**, then near the equilibrium, the system behaves exactly as the corresponding linear system $\frac{d}{dt}{\bf x}= J_{(x^{\ast},y^{\ast})}{\bf x}$ behaves. This is a result known as the [Hartman-Grobman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartman%E2%80%93Grobman_theorem) theorem.

Consider again the example system

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= 2x - 3xy \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= xy - 4y
\end{align*}
$$

which possesses equilibria $(0,0)$ and $(4,\frac{3}{2})$. Then 

$$
J(0,0) = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & -4 \end{array} \right), \ \ \ J(4,\frac{3}{2}) = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 0 & -12 \\ \frac{3}{2} & 0 \end{array} \right)
$$
For the linearization $J(0,0)$, the eigenvalues are $2$ and $-4$. Thus, we conclude that there is a saddle at $(0,0)$. On the other hand, the eigenvalues of $J(4,\frac{3}{2})$ are $\pm i 3\sqrt{2}$ which have zero real part and thus are pure imaginary. The Hartman-Grobman theorem does no apply and does not allow us to conclude  the dynamics near $(4,\frac{3}{2})$.

## Phase-Portaits

It is possible to study two-dimensional autonomous systems geometrically analogous to what we did with one-dimesional autonomous systems. But in this case, we draw a phase-plane instead of a phase-line. To understand this, first note that a solution to the system 

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= f(x,y) \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= g(x,y)
\end{align*}
$$
with initial condition $(x_{0},y_{0})$ will be a parametric curve in the plane passing through the point $(x_{0},y_{0})$. We refer to such as curve as a **trajectory** of the system, The right hand side of the system determines a vector field and these vectors are tangent to trajectories. Thus, if we plot the vector field, then we can see all of the trajectories by following vectors tangentially. 

For example, the following plot shows the vector field for

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= 2x - 3xy \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= xy - 4y
\end{align*}
$$
```{r vfieldexamp,echo=TRUE,code_folding=TRUE}
nonlinear_example <- function(t,state,parameters){
  with(as.list(c(state,parameters)),{
    
    dx <- 2*state[1] - 3*state[1]*state[2]
    dy <- state[1]*state[2] - 4*state[2]
    
    list(c(dx,dy))
  })
}

nonlinear_flowfield  <- flowField(nonlinear_example,
                                       xlim       = c(-0.5, 4.5),
                                       ylim       = c(-0.5, 3),
                                       parameters = NULL,
                                       points     = 17,
                                       add = FALSE)
```

It is easy to see that there is a saddle point at $(0,0)$. Furthermore, from the vector field it appears that there are rotations around $(4,\frac{3}{2})$ which suggests either a sprial or perhaps a nonlinear center. We will explore this further soon. First, reacll that if 
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= f(x,y) \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= g(x,y)
\end{align*}
$$

is a nonlinear system, the setting each component of the vector field to zero determines curves. Thus there are $f(x,y)=0$ curves and $g(x,y)=0$ curves. Such curves are called **nullclines**. This is due to the fact that along a $f(x,y)=0$ curve, we have that $\frac{dx}{dt}=0$ and hence there is no change in the $x$ direction. On the other hand, along  a $g(x,y)=0$ curve, we have that $\frac{dy}{dt}=0$ and hence there is no change in the $y$ direction. Note that equilibria points are exactly intersectoin points of distinct nullclines. The following plot shows the nullclines for the example system

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= 2x - 3xy \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= xy - 4y
\end{align*}
$$

```{r examplenulls,echo=TRUE,code_folding=TRUE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
nonlinear_flowfield  <- flowField(nonlinear_example,
                                       xlim       = c(-0.5, 4.5),
                                       ylim       = c(-0.5, 3),
                                       parameters = NULL,
                                       points     = 17,
                                       add = FALSE)
nonlinear_nullclines  <- nullclines(nonlinear_example,
                                       xlim       = c(-0.5, 4.5),
                                       ylim       = c(-0.5, 3),
                                       points=100,add.legend=FALSE)
eq1 <- findEquilibrium(nonlinear_example, y0 = c(0,0),
  plot.it = TRUE,summary=FALSE)
eq2 <- findEquilibrium(nonlinear_example, y0 = c(4,3/2),
  plot.it = TRUE,summary=FALSE)
```

We can see the equilibrium points at the intersection of distinct nullclines. Let's plot several trajectories to obtain a phase-portrait. 

```{r pplane,echo=TRUE,code_folding=TRUE}
nonlinear_flowfield  <- flowField(nonlinear_example,
                                       xlim       = c(-0.5, 4.5),
                                       ylim       = c(-0.5, 3),
                                       parameters = NULL,
                                       points     = 17,
                                       add = FALSE)
nonlinear_nullclines  <- nullclines(nonlinear_example,
                                       xlim       = c(-0.5, 4.5),
                                       ylim       = c(-0.5, 3),
                                       points=100,add.legend=FALSE)
eq1 <- findEquilibrium(nonlinear_example, y0 = c(0,0),
  plot.it = TRUE,summary=FALSE)
eq2 <- findEquilibrium(nonlinear_example, y0 = c(4,3/2),
  plot.it = TRUE,summary=FALSE)
state <- matrix(c(0.2,0.2,0.5,0.5,0,3,0,-1,0.01,0,-0.01,0,4,1.25),7,2,byrow = TRUE)
nonlinear_trajs <- trajectory(nonlinear_example,
                                        y0         = state,
                                        tlim       = c(0, 10),
                                        parameters = NULL,add=TRUE)
```

Notice that this system has trajectories that are closed curves in the plane. Thus, this system possesses periodic solutions. To confirm this, let's plot the time-series for one of the trajectories that appears to correspond to a periodic solution. Namely, let's plot the solution corresponding to initical condition $(4,1.25)$.

```{r, echo=TRUE,code_folding=TRUE}
num_sol <- numericalSolution(nonlinear_example,y0=c(4,1.25),tlim=c(0,10))
```


We will return to the topic of periodic solutions to nonlinear systems later. For now, note that linearization cannot typically be used to detect the existence of periodic solutions. 

## A Gallery of Two-Dimensional Systems

# Higher Dimensional Systems

As the dimension of a nonlinear system increases so does the difficulty in analyzing the equilibria and their stability properties. Once the dimension is three or greater, geometric analysis is very difficult to impossible. Thus, in *Topics in Biomathematics* we will resign ourselves to handling large nonlinear systems with numerical computing using the  `deSolve` package.
