## What is Biomathematics? 

Biomathematics is concerned with the use of mathematical methods (*e.g.*, linear algebra, differential equations, dynamical systems, and probability theory) to understand phenomenon in the life sciences, it is part of the larger field of [mathematical and theoretical biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_and_theoretical_biology#:~:text=Mathematical%20and%20theoretical%20biology%20is,biology%20which%20deals%20with%20the). Mathematical and theoretical biology provide a solid foundation for computational and quantitative approaches to investigations in biology and medicine.
