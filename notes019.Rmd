# Goals

After reading this section of notes, you should

1) know what is a membrane potential, an action potential, and an ion channel in the context of nerve cells (neurons);

2) have an appreciation for how the classical Hodgkin-Huxley ODEs model essential biophysics of neurons; and

2) be aware of some of the dynamics exhibited by neural systems and how this relates to neural physiology. 

# Background

Nerve cells known as [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron) can produce electrical impulses. During the 1940s and 1950s scientists conducted and published research results that elucidate the biophysics of nerve cell electrical impulses. This work is remarkable for its synthesis of experiment and theory. In particular, researchers measured electrical output from the [giant axon of a squid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_giant_axon) and used these measurements as a basis for deriving a mathematical model that captures key features of the so-called [action potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential) of the neuron. 

Noteworthy is the paper [*A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392413/) by [Alan Hodgkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Hodgkin) and [Andrew Huxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Huxley) which presents equations now known as the [Hodgkin-Huxley model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%E2%80%93Huxley_model). This paper is one in a series of five papers presenting research for which Hodgkin and Huxley where eventually awarded a [Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine). The Hodgkin-Huxley model is foundational for mathematical and [computational neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience), and the equations have generated a lot of interest in the field of biomathematics due to the interesting dynamics they exhibit. 

In this section of notes, we present the classical Hodgkin-Huxley ODEs and attempt to explain what they model. Additionally, we suggest some other avenues of research in mathematical neuroscience. We proceed by quickly reviewing the biophysical concepts that are most essential in understanding the meaning of the terms in the Hodgkin-Huxley model. 

# A Primer in Neural Biophysics 

Here we follow section 1.1 of [@borgersIntroductionModelingNeuronal2017] in presenting the biophysical background and terminology needed to understand the formulation of the classical Hodgkin-Huxley ODEs.  

Recall from physics that [electric potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential) is the work required to move a unit of electric charge. Nerve and muscle cells contain and are surrounded by charged particles in the form of ions. This may result in a difference in electric potential between the exterior and interior of a cell that is known as a [membrane potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential). Further, nerve and muscle cells are capable of generating brief spikes in the membrane potential creating what is known as an [action potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential).  Thus, physiologists say that nerve and muscle cells are **excitable**. Our goal is to understand and model the mechanisms underlying the electrical activity in nerve cells known as neurons.

[Neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron) are one of the primary cells in the brain. A neuron possesses a cell body known as a [soma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_(biology)), input branches called [dendrites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite), and an output unit known as an [axon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon). Moreover, neurons are filled and surrounded by fluid containing sodium ($\text{Na}^{+}$), potassium ($\text{K}^{+}$), chloride ($\text{Cl}^{-}$), and calcium ($\text{Ca}^{2+}$) ions. The superscripts denote the electric charge of the ion. We will denote the concentration of ion $\text{X}$ by $[\text{X}]_{\text{in}}$ if it is within the cell and $[\text{X}]_{\text{ex}}$ if it is outside the cell.  

It is known that ions can pass through the cell membrane of a neuron through so-called [ion channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel). These channels are typically ion specific in that a sodium ion channel only lets sodium through, a potassium channel only lets potassium through, and so on. Additionally, there are ion pumps at the neuron cell membrane that actively transport ions in or out of a cell but not necessarily at the same rate. For example, the well-known [sodium-potassium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-potassium_pump) pump removes sodium and intakes potassium at a 2 potassium for 3 sodium ratio. 

Researchers have observed experimentally the change in membrane potential of neurons. See, for example, figures in the paper of [Han et al,](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/135/9/2613/326668) where one can see a plot of a recording of membrane potential from a neuron in the superior cervical ganglion of a rat.
